PreGame UI

Game
  -if player leaves game inProgress, destroy the game and award a win/loss

DONE
  -change chat channel(room)
  - separate game lobby (players, ready status,countdown,gameStatus) and
in game objects (end zones, points, orbs, dashes) and have a reference prop to link them
so we can send just the data that is needed in the lobby
